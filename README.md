The term was introduced by Google Chrome engineer Alex Russell.

“So… Is it a technology? Is it a standard? Is it something owned/patented by Google?” No, none of those. It is simply a term to describe a specific way to design and build applications.

Here are the original 9 characteristics of PWA.

- Installable: Can be stored to the home screen just like native apps but without the extra hassle of the App Store
- Linkable: Can be shared around as plain URLs
