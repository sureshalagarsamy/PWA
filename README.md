[Reference](https://gofore.com/en/progressive-web-app-pwa-i-care/)

The term was introduced by Google Chrome engineer Alex Russell.

“So… Is it a technology? Is it a standard? Is it something owned/patented by Google?” No, none of those. It is simply a term to describe a specific way to design and build applications.

Here are the original 9 characteristics of PWA.

- Responsive: Page looks good on different screen sizes (e.g. phone, tablet, desktop)
- Connectivity independent: Function without Internet connection
- App-like-interactions: Look’n’feel of native application
- Fresh: Always up-to-date
- Safe: Utilise secure connection for the security threats
- Discoverable: Browsers identify PWAs automatically
- Re-engageable: Can bring users back to the app using, for example, Push Notifications
- Installable: Can be stored to the home screen just like native apps but without the extra hassle of the App Store
- Linkable: Can be shared around as plain URLs
